README

This is the repository for team Dijital Hijinks, a group of seniors working on a capstone project at Western Oregon University.

**What is in this Repository?**



1. The most up to date code for our current project, which is a road trip planner
2. All of the inception phase documents that we worked on before we started coding
*   This includes all idea documents as well as drawings (Mind Maps, ER Diagrams, Use Cases Drawings)

**Dijkstra's Road Trip**

This project was initially envisioned when one of our team members wanted to take a road trip through Oregon and stop at some different breweries. They found that there was no application that allowed them to plan a trip through breweries, thus, Djikstra’s Road Trip was born. We are developing a tool that will help brewery enthusiasts plan trips so they can experience breweries of all sorts.

**Vision Statement**

For People who want a way to generate the shortest path between pubs, the web app we created is the most convenient that you create a route through multiple points and end to certain areas. Unlike other systems like our product will be able to select pubs without having to manually enter addresses.

**Construction Process**

 Our approach on software development is analogous to that of nature’s tree- we begin with an initial vision and structure, focusing on core features, then building from this core, we grow our features as branches, our stories as twigs. As our core grows, our product grows. We don’t forget that the little things matter though- our leaves and flowers define our beauty as a whole.

We follow the Disciplined Agile Delivery process, just to make everything as simple as possible. We put the people in our group first, meaning that we want everyone in the group to feel comfortable to contribute on any part of the project. If anyone has any concerns about a part of the project, we want them to feel free to voice them at any time. 

As for the actual development process, we want to create a fully consumable product by the end of each sprint. This means that the product could be released at any time, and we have the ability to add other features on top of the core product. 

**Coding Conventions**



*   **C#-** Standard Microsoft coding [conventions]([https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions))
*   **Styling-** CSS in an external file only
*   **Database Creation-** Primary keys will start with the first letter of table name followed by “ID”. For example, ```Student``` table primary key will become ```SID```. Foreign keys will be the singular name of the table they refer to. For example, ```StudentID``` is a foreign key pointing back to the ```Students``` table.
